# Genesis Framework

Genesis Framework is a mod that implements a data-driven way to create dynamic age progression systems. These age progression systems are based on Advancements. Completing the Advancements unlocks different items, blocks, or even dimensions. Age progression is linear and can be used to add more friction to the vanilla progression system.
